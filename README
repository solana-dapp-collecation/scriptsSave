This script is resonsible for saving the data in the database everyday at 12am. Check implementation of
the function collectAndSaveData() to see how we use solana api's to get details of a wallet.

testWallets.json has the list of wallets we have indexed. Every time a new user logs on, the api will add 
their wallet address to this list so that it is indexed subsequently.

Check https://github.com/SOL-CAT/walletApis for apis that is used by the UI and how it uses the same 
collectAndSaveData() function that is present here for a new user.
